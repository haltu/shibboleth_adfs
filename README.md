Here you can find example configuration for Shibboleth SP
when connecting to Microsoft ADFS IdP.

The application is a multi-tenant Django site which has one login endpoint.
That endpoint handles HTTP headers coming from Shibboleth
and logs the user in based on the headers.

Example configuration has "EXAMPLE" written as a placeholder in places
you need to change.
